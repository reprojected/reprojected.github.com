    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another QGIS plugin idea I have had is to create a method of splitting the map canvas within QGIS to have two side-by-side maps that can track and interact with each other. There are lots of possibilities for this type of &#8220;reconfiguring&#8221; of the QGIS interface on the fly via plugins, so I decided to dive in and give it a go.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reprojected.com/presentations/Videos/mirrormap/alpha/mirrormap_final.html">Here is a link to a video</a> showing some of the basic operation of the MirrorMap plugin.</p>

<p>*** This plugin is very &#8220;Alpha&#8221; in that it makes the size of the map canvas static after invoking the plugin (until you launch QGIS again), does not handle layers of differing projections, does not allow for re-ordering layers in the mirror canvas, and many other deficiencies I am sure. But hey, its just a test!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I have been working on this last couple of months was a prototype of a Decision Support System (DSS) for web based interaction with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_power">In-Stream Tidal Power</a> data and models. Renewable energy is a big interest of mine and I was lucky enough to be involved in a local effort to look at In-Stream Tidal Power potential for Washington State.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reprojected.com/presentations/Videos/tisec/phase1/tisec_final.html">Here is a link to a video</a> showing some of the basic operation of the tool. We worked to integrate some post-processing analysis of 2-D circulation modeling to create both visual (maps) and tabular (graphs) on the fly via the web interface. The work is based on <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="http://extjs.com/">ExtJS</a>, <a href="http://www.openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a>, <a href="http://mapserver.org/">Mapserver</a> and a few other Open Source GIS projects from <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/">OSGeo</a>. Hopefully round 2 funding will happen to continue allow us to continue on with this fun project.</p>

    <link href="http://reprojected.github.com/blog/2009/02/09/refmap-webkit-in-pyqt/"/>
    <updated>2009-02-09T10:25:39-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://reprojected.github.com/blog/2009/02/09/refmap-webkit-in-pyqt</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So one of the ideas I have been pondering is how WebKit integration into QT (and PyQt) could be leveraged inside of my favorite open source desktop GIS, QGIS. I decided to make a very alpha plugin to show some of the cool possibilities, but I am still looking for a final direction to take the plugin. As always my plugins for QGIS <a href="http://qgisplugins.z-pulley.com/">can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>The general idea is to integrate many of the web based mapping API&#8217;s that exist into QGIS via a WebKit interface and try to link the QGIS map canvas to actions in those web pages.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reprojected.com/presentations/Videos/refmap/alpha/refmap_final.html">Here is a quick video</a> of the initial version of RefMap in action. There are still kinks to be worked out and more providers to add, but it is a good attempt at linking in bi-directional communication between a web page in WebKit and python in PyQt.</p>

    <updated>2009-02-06T14:08:12-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://reprojected.github.com/blog/2009/02/06/debugging-qgis-plugins</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, the title might better read &#8220;debugging <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro">PyQt</a> applications&#8230;&#8221;, but much of my PyQt foo happens when developing <a href="http://qgisplugins.z-pulley.com/">QGIS plugins</a>. In general I am old school&#8230; <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">gdb</a> are my friends. When it comes to developing in PyQt there is one life saving code snip that will make your life much easier:</p>

<pre><code>from PyQt4 import QtCore
import pdb
...
QtCore.pyqtRemoveInputHook()
pdb.set_trace()
</code></pre>

<p>This not only sets a trace (breakpoint) in your code, but it stops the PyQt event loop. The call to <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/static/Docs/PyQt4/pyqt4ref.html#using-pyqt-from-the-python-shell">pyqtRemoveInputHook()</a> is a tasty little tidbit in PyQt to allow for this &#8220;stop it in it&#8217;s tracks&#8221; behavior.  This is a must have for debugging PyQGIS or Python based plugins.</p>

<p>Once you are in <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/pdb.html">pdb</a>, you are set to go with interactive debugging:</p>

<pre><code>--Return--
&gt; /home/aaronr/.qgis/python/plugins/refmap/refmap.py(101)__init__()-&gt;None
-&gt; pdb.set_trace()
(Pdb) bt
&lt;string&gt;(1)&lt;module&gt;()
/home/aaronr/.qgis/python/plugins/refmap/refmap.py(144)initGui()
-&gt; self.refmap_gui = ReferenceMapWindow(self.iface,flags,self)
&gt; /home/aaronr/.qgis/python/plugins/refmap/refmap.py(101)__init__()-&gt;None
-&gt; pdb.set_trace()
(Pdb) print self
&lt;refmap.refmap.ReferenceMapWindow object at 0x8cc6c2c&gt;
(Pdb) print self.iface.mainWindow().windowTitle()
Quantum GIS - 1.1.0-Unstable-trunk
(Pdb)
</code></pre>

<p>Happy debugging!!!</p>

<p>Well, its been a while since I have had a chance to even think about blogging. I am currently in-between projects and it has been a great time to catchup on getting my development environment up-to-date, test out some new ideas, and of course prune the orchard! Spring is here and with over 70 trees to get in shape much of the next couple of months will be on a ladder. Another development in the works is trying to start 2 bee hives in the orchard this year.</p>

<p>I have been starting to dive back into QGIS and plugin development. There are some really cool things on the horizon and I will be posting about some of the things I am looking at over the next couple of weeks. Of particular interest to me is the new WebKit integration to QT that happened at QT version 4.4+.</p>

<p>More to come soon&#8230;</p>

We had a great room full of people interested in Geospatial technology, some great questions and I think some genuine interest from participants that could lead to some folks going home and hacking away with some mapping.  Great job to the organizers of the event and looking forward to helping make LinuxFestNW 2009 an even bigger and better event!</p>

    <link href="http://reprojected.github.com/blog/2007/10/11/getting-qgis-to-install-on-windows-and-support-python-apps/"/>
    <updated>2007-10-11T09:55:56-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://reprojected.github.com/blog/2007/10/11/getting-qgis-to-install-on-windows-and-support-python-apps</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So here are the simple (kind of) steps as of today to get a windows install of QGIS working that supports PyQt and the python bindings to QGIS&#8230; all with out having to compile anything:</p>

<p>1) Make sure you have Python 2.5 or newer installed on your machine&#8230; if you don&#8217;t have it you can download it from <a href="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.5.1/python-2.5.1.msi">HERE</a> (official) or <a href="http://www.reprojected.com/qgis_dev/dev_files/qt4.3.1_based/Python/python-2.5.1.msi">HERE</a> (my archive).</p>

<p>2) Install PyQt4.3.1 from <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/Downloads/PyQt4/GPL/PyQt-Py2.5-gpl-4.3.1-1.exe">HERE</a> (official) or <a href="http://www.reprojected.com/qgis_dev/dev_files/qt4.3.1_based/PyQt/PyQt-Py2.5-gpl-4.3.1-1.exe">HERE</a> (my archive)</p>

<p>3) Download and unpack <a href="http://www.reprojected.com/qgis_dev/dev_files/qt4.3.1_based/PyQt/PyQt4.zip">THIS</a> zip file.  Copy the PyQt4 directory unpacked from the zip into your Python 2.5 site-packages directory.  Make sure to save the old PyQt4 directory in the site-packages by renaming it in case something goes wrong!</p>

<p>4) Download and install QGIS from <a href="http://www.reprojected.com/qgis_dev/dev_files/qt4.3.1_based/QGIS/qgis_setup0.9.0.11_10_2007.exe">HERE</a> (my archive).  This is the latest release candidate from what_nick that is based on the Qt4.3.1 series.</p>

<p>5) In the QGIS install there are some GRASS documentation files that are missing and can cause warning dialogs to pop up when using the GRASS toolbox.  You can unzip the contents of <a href="http://www.reprojected.com/qgis_dev/dev_files/qt4.3.1_based/QGIS/qgis0.9_grass_docs.zip">THIS</a> archive into the QGISDIR\grass\docs\html directory to stop the warnings.</p>

<p>You can still follow the instructions <a href="http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BuildingFromSource">HERE</a> to build QGIS yourself and play to your hearts content, but I know that there are many windows users out there that really would just like to get moving without the hassle of compiling.  This post is for you.</p>

<p>Well, it was a great week in Victoria BC for this years <a href="http://www.foss4g2007.org/">FOSS4G</a> conference!  Besides the great chance to hang out with the OS GIS community, it was a great chance to take a look at what is hot in our field.

<p>We also had a great <a href="http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/FOSS4G2007_BOF_Sessions">QGIS BOF</a> session which was well attended by a <a href="http://www.reprojected.com/presentations/Presentations/FOSS4G_2007/bof_2.jpg">diverse group</a> of <a href="http://www.reprojected.com/presentations/Presentations/FOSS4G_2007/bof_3.jpg">developers</a>, <a href="http://www.reprojected.com/presentations/Presentations/FOSS4G_2007/bof_1.jpg">users</a>, and interested newbies.  All in all I think QGIS had a great showing at FOSS4G and am looking forward to pushing many of the ideas talked about there forward.</p>

<p>Well, you can now <a href="http://www.reprojected.com/geoblog/how-tos/video/">watch me fumble around installing</a> a new Ubuntu system and getting it all ready for development using much of the Open Source GIS stack, including QGIS, PostGIS, GDAL/OGR and many others&#8230;</p>

<p>Of particular interest:</p>

<p>1) Demo of installing new 0.9 branch of QGIS on Ubuntu Linux</p>

<p>2) Demo of using Python bindings for QGIS</p>

<p>I have a habit of installing from source, and most of the demos I am producing are walking through the install process doing just that&#8230; beware!</p>

<p>Enjoy, and I would be interested if there are things in the Open Source stack that people are interested in seeing a demo of&#8230;</p>

<p>Just returned from a week on the road and one of the highlights was <a href="http://www.orurisa.org/events/gisinact/2007event/index.html">GIS in Action</a>, the <a href="http://www.orurisa.org/">Oregon and Southwest Washington URISA</a> annual GIS event.  There were over 300 people on site for 2 days of great talks, workshops and panels.  I was asked again to host one of the Open Source sessions at the conference and we participated on Wednesday.  I presented on the OSGeo, some sample applications of the Open Source GIS technology, and even had a quick online IRC chat with Chris Schmidt of Openlayers in front of the crowd.  We also had <a href="http://www.co.polk.or.us/Central%20Services/GIS.asp">Dean Anderson from Polk County</a> talking about doing open development when confined to a proprietary environment (often the case in government).  He had some great examples of developing Arc based software on SourceForge.  Finally we had <a href="http://staff.osuosl.org/~deborah/">Deborah Bryant</a> from the <a href="http://osuosl.org/">Oregon State University Open Source Lab (OSU OSL)</a> to talk about government uptake of Open Source technology.  She provides great insight to the front lines of getting Open Source accepted in main stream government.  She runs the <a href="http://goscon.org/">GOSCON</a> conference and is a wealth of knowledge on the current state of Open Source in government, big and small.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reprojected.com/geoblog/presentations/">All of the presentations from our Open Source session are posted in my presentation archive&#8230;</a></p>

<p>(UPDATE: Ecotrust has asked me to remove material related to the Calzone and Gulf Tool. Please feel free to contact Ecotrust directly to find out more about those tools)</p>

<p>I have been working on a new decision support tool for <a href="http://www.ecotrust.org/">Ecotrust</a> over the last few months, so today I decided to make some screen casts (with audio!) of some of our work.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reprojected.com/demo/cal-zone-demo.html">Cal-Zone</a> - Web based DST based on <a href="http://www.ecology.uq.edu.au/marxan.htm">Marxan / Marzone</a> for helping evaluate site selection of <a href="http://www.dfg.ca.gov/Mrd/mlpa/index.html">marine protected areas</a>.  Marxan / Marzone results are generated and stored in <a href="http://www.postgis.org/">PostGIS</a> for display via <a href="http://www.openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a>.  New windowing functionality introduced to allow for future enhancements such as multi-run comparisons and use of region of interest tools for site selection.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reprojected.com/demo/cal-zone-demo.html">http://www.reprojected.com/demo/cal-zone-demo.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reprojected.com/demo/gulf-demo.html">Gulf Tool</a> - Web based DST based around scenario development for Gulf of Mexico fisheries.  Uses a <a href="http://chameleon.maptools.org/index.phtml">Chameleon</a> based frontend, <a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/">Mapserver</a> on the backend and all data storage and queries through <a href="http://www.postgis.org/">PostGIS</a>.  <a href="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/">GMT</a> is used for graphing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reprojected.com/demo/gulf-demo.html">http://www.reprojected.com/demo/gulf-demo.html</a></p>

<p>Just a snapshot into some of the DST development we are undertaking and very excited about.  Hope you enjoy&#8230;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CUGOSians,</p>

<p>Hope all are well.  I just wanted to send out a quick reminder that we will be having our first <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cugos">CUGOS meeting</a> tomorrow (Wednesday - 03/21/07) at the <a href="http://www.lizardtech.com/company/contact.php">Seattle LizardTech offices</a>.  We will kick things off at 5:30pm and wrap-up by 7pm.  Some of us will most likely grab a beer near by after as well.  Looks to be a great turnout with about 30 new people signed up!</p>

<p>I am really looking forward to meeting everyone and making these meetings a great venue for social interaction and learning for Open Source GIS professionals.  See you all tomorrow!</p>

<p>Well, I am back again after being been hit by the <a href="http://www.planetgs.com/">Planet Geospatial</a> Voodoo.  <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/">James</a> has been nice enough to go under the hood of the <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2007/02/15/planet-gs-down-but-there-is-good-news/">ever so sensative PG</a> and re-link to my blog.  Must have been dropped in the shuffle of the last few months, but rest assured I have not gone away.  I have had some new info posted since last I was linked here and hope that some people find it useful&#8230;</p>
