<p>(UPDATE: Ecotrust has asked me to remove material related to the Calzone and Gulf Tool. Please feel free to contact Ecotrust directly to find out more about those tools)</p>

<p>I have been working on a new decision support tool for <a href="http://www.ecotrust.org/">Ecotrust</a> over the last few months, so today I decided to make some screen casts (with audio!) of some of our work.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reprojected.com/demo/cal-zone-demo.html">Cal-Zone</a> - Web based DST based on <a href="http://www.ecology.uq.edu.au/marxan.htm">Marxan / Marzone</a> for helping evaluate site selection of <a href="http://www.dfg.ca.gov/Mrd/mlpa/index.html">marine protected areas</a>.  Marxan / Marzone results are generated and stored in <a href="http://www.postgis.org/">PostGIS</a> for display via <a href="http://www.openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a>.  New windowing functionality introduced to allow for future enhancements such as multi-run comparisons and use of region of interest tools for site selection.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reprojected.com/demo/gulf-demo.html">Gulf Tool</a> - Web based DST based around scenario development for Gulf of Mexico fisheries.  Uses a <a href="http://chameleon.maptools.org/index.phtml">Chameleon</a> based frontend, <a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/">Mapserver</a> on the backend and all data storage and queries through <a href="http://www.postgis.org/">PostGIS</a>.  <a href="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/">GMT</a> is used for graphing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reprojected.com/demo/gulf-demo.html">http://www.reprojected.com/demo/gulf-demo.html</a></p>

<p>Just a snapshot into some of the DST development we are undertaking and very excited about.  Hope you enjoy...</p>

<p>I have posted a <a href="http://www.reprojected.com/geoblog/presentations/">new presentation</a> on Open Source GIS that I gave on Feb 21st 2007 at Portland State University. Included is an audio recording of the talk, a ppt presentation, and a flash demo of doing some simple GRASS interaction.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Man you cant get any better than this:</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/index.php/Non-profit_Discount">http://wiki.dreamhost.com/index.php/Non-profit_Discount</a></p>

<p>We at <a href="http://www.ecotrust.org/">Ecotrust</a> just signed up... can't beat 1/2 terabyte of storage and 5 terabytes of bandwidth... FREE!</p>

<p>This personal blog is hosted there as well under my personal account, but if you are a non-profit interested in playing with Mapserver/PostGIS/GMT/GRASS you can check out <a href="http://www.reprojected.com/geoblog/how-tos/gis-on-a-shared-hosting-environment-the-magic-of-not-having-root/">my post</a> on installation in this environment to get up and running with web mapping... FOR FREE!!!</p>

<p>Enjoy</p>

<p>UPDATE (12/09/06): For those who are not in the non-profit world but are still interested in Dreamhost for cheap hosting I just created a promo code that gives the FULL $97 discount to youâ€¦ Nothing to me. Dreamhost works on this crazy "reward" system for getting people to use you as a referal, offering a finders fee to the current customer. I have created this code to apply all of the finders fee to your discount... I get NOTHING. It is <strong>ZPULLEYFULL </strong>, enjoy!</p>
