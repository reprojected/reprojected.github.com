    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Man you cant get any better than this:</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/index.php/Non-profit_Discount">http://wiki.dreamhost.com/index.php/Non-profit_Discount</a></p>

<p>We at <a href="http://www.ecotrust.org/">Ecotrust</a> just signed up... can't beat 1/2 terabyte of storage and 5 terabytes of bandwidth... FREE!</p>

<p>This personal blog is hosted there as well under my personal account, but if you are a non-profit interested in playing with Mapserver/PostGIS/GMT/GRASS you can check out <a href="http://media.reprojected.com/geoblog/how-tos/gis-on-a-shared-hosting-environment-the-magic-of-not-having-root/">my post</a> on installation in this environment to get up and running with web mapping... FOR FREE!!!</p>

<p>Enjoy</p>

<p>UPDATE (12/09/06): For those who are not in the non-profit world but are still interested in Dreamhost for cheap hosting I just created a promo code that gives the FULL $97 discount to youâ€¦ Nothing to me. Dreamhost works on this crazy "reward" system for getting people to use you as a referal, offering a finders fee to the current customer. I have created this code to apply all of the finders fee to your discount... I get NOTHING. It is <strong>ZPULLEYFULL </strong>, enjoy!</p>
