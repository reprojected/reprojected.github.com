This last spring (2012) I had the opportunity to host a local 7th grader for 3 months as an "apprentice".  This was the first time for me as a small business owner to participate... but it turned out to be a great experience.

We had the opportunity to [edit OSM data](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=48.03622&lon=-122.40634&zoom=16&layers=M) in our local community, get out and do some GPS data collection, and [share our experience with other apprenticeship programs](http://www.serviceeducationadventure.org/) in the region.

Will Simms (my apprentice and all around great kid) did some great work and as part of the program generated a presentation in OpenOffice (on an Ubuntu laptop) which you can check out here:

Looking forward to participating in the program again this spring... and encourage all you GIS folks out there to find a way to participate in education through your local school system... there are always lots of opportunities!
