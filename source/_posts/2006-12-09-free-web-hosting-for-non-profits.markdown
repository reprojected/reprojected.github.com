Man you cant get any better than this:

[http://wiki.dreamhost.com/index.php/Non-profit_Discount](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/index.php/Non-profit_Discount)

We at [Ecotrust](http://www.ecotrust.org/) just signed up... can't beat 1/2 terabyte of storage and 5 terabytes of bandwidth... FREE!

This personal blog is hosted there as well under my personal account, but if you are a non-profit interested in playing with Mapserver/PostGIS/GMT/GRASS you can check out [my post](http://media.reprojected.com/geoblog/how-tos/gis-on-a-shared-hosting-environment-the-magic-of-not-having-root/) on installation in this environment to get up and running with web mapping... FOR FREE!!!

Enjoy

UPDATE (12/09/06): For those who are not in the non-profit world but are still interested in Dreamhost for cheap hosting I just created a promo code that gives the FULL $97 discount to youâ€¦ Nothing to me. Dreamhost works on this crazy "reward" system for getting people to use you as a referal, offering a finders fee to the current customer. I have created this code to apply all of the finders fee to your discount... I get NOTHING. It is **ZPULLEYFULL **, enjoy!
