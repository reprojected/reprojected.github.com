A little "trip report" from Whidbey Island!

Yesterday I ventured off the Island in the afternoon for a whirl  wind tour of Seattle events.  

1) Met with some folks from [LizardTech](http://www.lizardtech.com/), a GIS shop in Seattle  who has been in the imagery/compression business for a  long time and is really trying to re-define their  business around what is happening in the GIS industry as a whole.

They are now an Associate Sponsor of the [OSGeo (Open Source  Geospatial](https://www.osgeo.org/)[ ](https://www.osgeo.org/)[Foundation)](https://www.osgeo.org/) and very actively engaging parts  of their business in the OS paradigm.  Very  cool office downtown and some great Northwest contacts.

2) [Seattle Green Drinks](http://www.biothinking.com/greendrinks/index.php?country=USA&city=Seattle).

![SAM](http://www.iamsamcampaign.org/downloads/exterior_park_and_pavilion_smaller.jpg)A group of us hit this event at the new [Seattle Art Museum  waterfront](http://wwwseattleartmuseum.org/visit/OSP/default.asp)[ ](http://wwwseattleartmuseum.org/visit/OSP/default.asp)[sculpture garden](http://wwwseattleartmuseum.org/visit/OSP/default.asp) and had a great time.  Defiantly worth seeing the 60  foot nurse log... on display as a "living" piece of  art.  Probably one of the largest and most active Enviro  social events I have been to.  300+ people all bumping into each other with free beer and wine... great stuff.  With my tour guides  from [Umbrella Consulting](http://www.umbrellaconsulting.com/) I got a very good introduction to many of the  organizations based out of Seattle including OneNW ([http://www.onenw.org/](http://www.onenw.org/)), Grist ([http://www.grist.org/](http://www.grist.org/)), Cascade  Agenda ([http://www.cascadeagenda.org/](http://www.cascadeagenda.org/)),  and many more.  Awesome event and will hopefully be a  monthly thing for me.

3) [Ignite Seattle](http://igniteseattle.com/).  

![Ignite](http://www.reprojected.com/images/general/Ignite.jpg)Wow... you  have never seen so many hackers, geeks, and crazy people  in one room... it was good to feel welcome!  8pm until almost midnight of straight  through 5-minute talks... about 22 of them from every topic including new technology out of the Google and Microsoft labs to building a  multi-person pogo stick for Burning Man!  Crazy stuff,  high energy event which is gaining in popularity (now  sponsored by [Google](http://www.google.com/) and [O'Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/)).  Again, every couple  of months and a great connection to the roots of the OS and hacker  community in Seattle.  I do hope it does not get taken over by the corporate mongers (I hope you are listening O'Reilly!)

2am arrival back home has not done great things for productivity, but all in all one of the most productive  days I have spent in the community.
