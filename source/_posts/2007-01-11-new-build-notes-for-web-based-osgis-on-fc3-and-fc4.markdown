I went ahead and added some build notes that I have created in the past for setting up new Fedora based machines with a web GIS stack.  Currently building on FC6 and will post soon.  Hope this helps some folks out.

[FC3](http://media.reprojected.com/geoblog/how-tos/fc3-setup-old-but-good/) and [FC4 ](http://media.reprojected.com/geoblog/how-tos/fc4-getting-warmer/)

Also, added a couple more [historical presentations](http://media.reprojected.com/geoblog/presentations/) for archiving!
