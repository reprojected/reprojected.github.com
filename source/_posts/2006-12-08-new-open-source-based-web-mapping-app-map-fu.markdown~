A local group here at Portland State University has just announced a new mapping interface into the mix.  Check out the live demos and download the code.  Looks to be a great resource!  Thanks guys...




> We are delighted to announce a new open source framework for web-mapping, your personal Ninja of web-mapping, ladies and gentlemen, it's:
> 
> *Map-Fu*
> 
> Available for download, contribution of code, or reporting of bugs at our not-so-secret location on sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/map-fu/
> 
> It features a true object-oriented PHP-Mapscript backend, with a variety
of classes and interfaces, ease of extensibility, and other
configuration zoink-zoink.
> 
> On the front end is a fat Javascript client, using XMLHttpRequest to communicate with the server for updating the map and map-related data. It employs JSON for messaging and goes for a Web 2.0 feel. Some features on the front-end include pop-up tabs for reference map, legend, map information and query results. We try to maximize screen area for the map, since that's what we are interested in visually!
> 
> Based on Minnesota Mapserver (of course) and PostGIS, we developed this interface to satisfy actual needs of clients for creating web-mapping applications that served SPECIFIC needs and required SPECIFIC tools.
> 
> Some production sites that are using the Map-Fu or related codebase (formerly known as YAMI (Yet Another Map Interface)):
> 
> http://glaciers.us - A database of glacier change in the Western US, including a linked assets database of aerial and oblique photos from the last century
> 
> http://www.oregongeology.com/sub/ogdc/index.htm - The most up-to-date geology compilation for Oregon, soon to be used for other states!
> 
> http://oscdl.research.pdx.edu/ - Oregon Sustainable
Communities Digital Library, a temporal database of regional planning for the Portland Metro area (ten years of regional planning data, plus links to documents tied to spatial objects)
> 
> We look forward to collaborating with a larger group of developers, and receiving feedback on our efforts! We're interested in incorporating the OpenLayers interface, and "through the web" feature editing via WFS-T.
> 
> In the current vacuum of viable enterprise GIS solutions, we see this as a ripe time for rapid development!

Morgan, Cris, Tim, Percy & Will
