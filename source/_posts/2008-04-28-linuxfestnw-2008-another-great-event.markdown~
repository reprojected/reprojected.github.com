I had the privilege of giving a talk at [LinuxFest Northwest](http://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/) this year... and what a cool event this is.  We had a great room full of people interested in Geospatial technology, some great questions and I think some genuine interest from participants that could lead to some folks going home and hacking away with some mapping.  Great job to the organizers of the event and looking forward to helping make LinuxFestNW 2009 an even bigger and better event!
