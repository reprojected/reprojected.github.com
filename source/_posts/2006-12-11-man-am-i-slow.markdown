[Sean Gillies](http://zcologia.com/) [posted](http://zcologia.com/news/314) about this talk at the end of November and it just got posted on [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/12/10/1553242) yesterday, but it was only until last night that I woke up and watched it.  While _ [Eben Moglen](http://plone.org/events/conferences/seattle-2006/agenda/watch-eben-moglen-s-plone-conference-keynote-address) _might not be able to bring down the house with his camera presence, his talk on social justice and Open Source software is truly interesting and inspiring.

Well worth it... an hour well spent.
