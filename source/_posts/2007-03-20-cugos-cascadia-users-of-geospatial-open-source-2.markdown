CUGOSians,

Hope all are well.  I just wanted to send out a quick reminder that we will be having our first [CUGOS meeting](http://groups.google.com/group/cugos) tomorrow (Wednesday - 03/21/07) at the [Seattle LizardTech offices](http://www.lizardtech.com/company/contact.php).  We will kick things off at 5:30pm and wrap-up by 7pm.  Some of us will most likely grab a beer near by after as well.  Looks to be a great turnout with about 30 new people signed up!

I am really looking forward to meeting everyone and making these meetings a great venue for social interaction and learning for Open Source GIS professionals.  See you all tomorrow!
