Well, you can now [watch me fumble around installing](http://www.reprojected.com/geoblog/how-tos/video/) a new Ubuntu system and getting it all ready for development using much of the Open Source GIS stack, including QGIS, PostGIS, GDAL/OGR and many others...

Of particular interest:

1) Demo of installing new 0.9 branch of QGIS on Ubuntu Linux

2) Demo of using Python bindings for QGIS

I have a habit of installing from source, and most of the demos I am producing are walking through the install process doing just that... beware!

Enjoy, and I would be interested if there are things in the Open Source stack that people are interested in seeing a demo of...
