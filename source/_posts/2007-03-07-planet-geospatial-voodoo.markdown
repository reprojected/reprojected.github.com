Well, I am back again after being been hit by the [Planet Geospatial](http://www.planetgs.com/) Voodoo.  [James](http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/) has been nice enough to go under the hood of the [ever so sensative PG](http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2007/02/15/planet-gs-down-but-there-is-good-news/) and re-link to my blog.  Must have been dropped in the shuffle of the last few months, but rest assured I have not gone away.  I have had some new info posted since last I was linked here and hope that some people find it useful...
