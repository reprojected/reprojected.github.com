Had the need to install Mapserver/PostGIS/GDAL etc on a FC8 box. While 99% of what I do now is on Ubuntu ([here are some notes and vids on installing there](http://www.reprojected.com/how-tos/video/))... I occasionally need to play on a Fedora box. So, [here are some recent install notes](http://www.reprojected.com/how-tos/fc8-oh-why-am-i-installing-on-fedora/) from a bare bones FC8 box to get it all going from source...
