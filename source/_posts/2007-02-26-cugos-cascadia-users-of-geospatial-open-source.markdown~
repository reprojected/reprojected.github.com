[We are off and running!](http://groups.google.com/group/cugos) Josh Livni ([Umbrella Consulting](http://www.umbrellaconsulting.com/)), Michael Gerlek ([LizardTech](http://www.lizardtech.com/)) and Aaron  Racicot [ME!] ([Ecotrust](http://www.ecotrust.org/)) got together and decided it was time to rally the troops. We have scheduled our first official meeting to take place at the [LizardTech office in Seattle on the 21st of March](http://groups.google.com/group/cugos/browse_thread/thread/e659be865da00fc3/d4959a9210402ee5#d4959a9210402ee5). We hope to see many of the GIS professionals in the Puget Sound region for this great time to meet others in the area who share a passion for Open Source GIS.




See you there!
