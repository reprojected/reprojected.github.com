Paul and company up in Victoria BC have posted info about the [2007 FOSS4G conference](http://www.foss4g2007.org/index.html).  I cant wait for September to role around... this should be a great conference this year!


    FOSS4G takes place September 24-27, 2007, at the [Victoria Conference Center](http://www.foss4g2007.org/conference_venue.html), in [Victoria](http://www.foss4g2007.org/about_victoria.html), British Columbia, Canada.

This year the OSGeo will be taking a large role in the development of this conference and it will be great to see how it works out. I personally have high hopes that this will be a defining moment for the OSGeo and the FOSS4G community as a whole.
