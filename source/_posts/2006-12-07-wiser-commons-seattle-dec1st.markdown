I had the pleasure of attending a [meeting](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/8542) on the [WISER commons](http://sustainapedianw.org/index.php?title=Image:BaWClittle.jpg) last Friday (December 1st) in Seattle Washington.  It was a great meeting bringing together environmentally minded individuals and organizations that have a common "technology" thread.  The event was sponsored by the [Interra Project](http://www.interraproject.org/) and the [Natural Capital Institute](http://www.naturalcapital.org/index.html).  [Paul Hawken](http://www.paulhawken.com/) spoke about the need and relevance of a "commons" and promoted a new project called WISER.  The [demo shown](http://www.wiserbusiness.org/) was an impressive database of socially responsible organizations around the world.  I am excited to see this project grow as it is aiming to socially connect the environmental movement.

I am interested to tear into their code as the software being developed is Open Source and should be interesting.  They are due to put out a public release in January!
