OK, I have servers at work that I use daily to develop Mapserver/GDAL/OGR/GRASS/GMT/etc... based apps, but how about on a shared hosting environment?

Well, I finally got it going. I have written up my [install instructions](http://media.reprojected.com/geoblog/?page_id=6) for Mapserver/GDAL/OGR/Proj/Postgres/Postgis/Geos/GMT/GRASS on [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com), a debian based shared hosting service. The great thing about it...

**1)** It cost $9.95/month (1 year contract) *12 = $119.40

**2)** You can use a discount code to get $97 off... Total cost at sign-up = $119.40-$97 = $22.40

UPDATE (12/09/06): I just created a propmo code that gives the FULL discount to you... Nothing to me.Â  It is **ZPULLEYFULL **, enjoy! 

**3)** Add a domain for $9.95 and the first year of this site cost $32.35 ... WOW

With this [package](http://www.dreamhost.com/shared) I get 200 Gigs of space (grows weekely!) and 1 Terabyte of bandwidth/month (grows weekly!).

So what good is it if I cant do some mapping work with it? Well, I have posted notes how I was able to get a fully functional Mapserver/PostGIS environment up. I went as far as to get command line GRASS installed to do geo-processing sans the GUI. GMT installed like a breeze, and bammmm... a GIS work environment.

Cant beat the rent ;-)

Check out some demo's running on the server:

**1)** [ka-map](http://media.reprojected.com/apps/ka-map/)

**2)** GMT
