I own a private software development company called Z-Pulley Inc.  I received my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Washington and my M.S. in Environmental Science from [Oregon Health and Science University](http://www.ogi.edu/ebs/).  I am a certified [GIS professional (GISP - 00053691)](http://www.gisci.org/) with over 6 years of professional GIS experience.  I worked as an embedded systems developer for many years before turning my focus toward GIS combining for over 13 years of professional software development experience.

I love to white water raft (I am guiding in the back!), telemark ski, and climb in the alpine environment.

I recently moved to wonderful Whidbey Island in Washinton State where I now work out of my home office.

I have a nice home network consisting of two development Linux boxes, 1.6 TB of RAID5 NAS storage, and a UPS and generator system.

I am also an advocate for the [OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/), participating internally as well as speaking at conferences and workshops about the use and development of Open Source GIS technology.

Drop me a line... I would love to hear from you!
